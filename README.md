**Paisa** is a command line tool and Web UI to visualize personal
finance. It builds on top of the [ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/) double entry accounting
tool. Checkout [documentation](https://ananthakumaran.in/paisa/) to get started.

# Demo

A demo of the Web UI can be found at [https://paisa-demo.ananthakumaran.in](https://paisa-demo.ananthakumaran.in)

## Status

I use it to track my personal finance. It's more like alpha product
now, usable, but I might update things based on the feedback I
receive. Feel free to open an issue if you found a bug or start a
discussion if you have a feature request. If you have any question,
you can ask on [Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#paisa:matrix.org).
